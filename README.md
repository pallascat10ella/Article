# Making Scents of Music

Perfumes have been around for thousands of years. ==Mesopotamians=={Q8807346} had incense and engaged in ritualistic uses of fragrance as early as 4000 BCE. Upper-class families in Ancient China wore scented beads and carried perfumed pouches. Cleopatra was said to have ==tantalized Marc Antony with Mendesian perfume=={2,1719,1000,800|da25c726}, a concoction originating in the ancient city of ==Mendes=={Q1427162} made from desert date oil, myrrh, cinnamon, and pine resin.[^1] During these early periods, the two primary methods used to extract and preserve fragrance were ==*distillation*=={Q101017} and ==*enfleurage*=={Q900621}, processes which capture the essential oils of natural objects by heating the fragrant materials in water (*distillation*) or using fat, grease, oil, and butter to absorb the target scent (*enfleurage*).

While these two methods of scent extraction are still used today, they have notable limitations. *Distillation* is difficult to perform on more fragile materials. It is thus often reserved for hardier substances like cedar, ==caraway=={Q26811}, lemon, ==bergamot=={Q109196}, and other barks, leaves, seeds, and fruits which were better able to withstand the distillation process.  *Enfleurage* is labor intensive, expensive, and has a low yield. As a result, for most of history perfume was deployed in very specific circumstances: in religious ceremonies and by members of the upper class to mask poor hygiene or distinguish themselves from the rest of society. This changed in the latter half of the nineteenth century when, following a series of discoveries in the chemical, technological, and industrial spaces, perfume became an object accessible to the larger public and subsequently transformed from a marker of the elite into a widely distributed commodity of the middle class.

##Nineteenth-century Discoveries in Chemical Synthesis 

The foundations for this transformation were laid in 1828, when Friedrich Wöhler, a German chemist, synthesized ==urea=={Q48318} by evaporating a solution of ammonium cyanate, thereby establishing that organic compounds could be synthesized from inorganic substances. By the 1870s, chemists were developing artificial scents like piperonal (which smells like ==heliotrope=={Q158082} flowers), ==coumarin=={Q111812} (the scent of freshly mown hay), vanillin (vanilla), and musk, first in smaller amounts in the lab and then in industrial bulk quantities in the 1880s. 

The discovery with these new synthetic compounds paired with the introduction of steam power in perfume factories radically altered the perfume industry. Perfume manufacturers were no longer at the mercy of expensive and lengthy supply chains which imported ylang-ylang from the ==Philippines=={14.60352,120.96909 9}, Geranium from ==Réunion=={-21.10756,55.44525 8} and ==Algeria=={36.88401,3.04321 8}, citron from ==Sri Lanka=={7.12811,79.81023 7}, and musk from ==musk-cats=={Q198342} in ==China=={39.90289,116.37613 10} to factories in the south of ==France=={43.3072,4.07317 8}. It was now not only possible, but faster and cheaper to produce fragrances at home.

##Early Classifications of Perfume

Early classifications of scent had only a handful of categories with often vague or confusing labels. Some scent theorists proposed dividing odors into only two classes: agreeable and disagreeable. The Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) organized fragrances into seven categories: aromatic, fragrant, ambrosial, alliaceous (that is, relating to ==allium=={Q49391} plants like the onion), fetid, repulsive, and nauseous. French chemist Antoine-Francois de Fourcroy (1755-1809) suggested five categories of odor: “muquous,” “fugacious oily,” “volatile oily,” “aromatic and acid,” and “hydrosulphurous.”[^2] There were many issues with these proposed classification groups, which is likely why they were never employed in the perfume-manufacturing space. The perfumer Eugene Rimmel (1821-1887) declared these categories to be “more theoretical than practical,” especially since they did not allow specification for how the odoriferous groups related to one another.[^3]

##Sound, Color, Fragrance: Synaesthetic Models for Scent

It was not until the 1860s when the modern system of describing perfumes in terms of “notes” was established. In his foundational 1867 guide, *The Art of Perfumery*, G.W. Septimus Piesse (1820-1882) outlined observations on scent’s “immaterial powers.”[^4] Drawing comparisons between odor and other “imponderable agents”—namely, music and color—Piesse looked to scientific theories about musical synaesthesia. In 1845, the chemist George Field had published *Chromatics; or the Analogy, Harmony, and Philosophy of Colors* wherein he drew parallels between the way the eye processes color and the ear understands harmony. Outlining ways to achieve “melodies” and “harmonies” of color, Field arranged the notes of a musical scale to correspond to an organization of colors which resembled a rainbow, with *do* corresponding to Blue, *re* to Purple, and then Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, and Green (again) respectively up the ==musical scale=={Q159563}.[^5] The properties of color pairing and composition, Field argued, were analogous to those found in music theory. According to this theory, colorful “chords” which sound good to the ear would similarly appeal to the eye. The standard major triad of *do*, *mi*, *so*, for instance, translates into the three primary colors: blue, red, and yellow. 

Piesse became fascinated by Field’s theories of musically harmonic color, interpreting the systems outlined in Chromatics as proof of the existence of a universal “law of harmony.” In accordance with this law, Piesse laid out his own proposal for a harmony of odors organized around what he called an *odophone*:

>*“Scents, like sounds, appear to influence the olfactory nerve in certain definite degrees. There is, as it were, an octave of odors like an octave in music; certain odors coincide, like the keys of an instrument."[^6]*

Piesse argued that harmony and discord in fragrance could similarly be defined in perfumery by building “chords” of related odors. He directed perfumers to use the *odophone* to build their perfumes in correspondence with the rules of music theory and Field’s theory of color composition. Subsequent fragrance designers adopted Piesse's theories and came up with a framework of three layers: the "top notes," which are the scents most immediately noticeable; "heart notes," which appear just as the top notes are fading away; and "base notes," which form the foundation of the perfume and last the longest. This method of using a chord of "notes" is used by perfume houses all over the world today.
